	<h1>Anna E. Bartlett</h1>
	<h2>A Brief History of my Life</h2>
	<p>Languages have always been one of my greatest interests and passions. I was born in <span class="place">Salzburg, Austria,</span> where I was raised bilingually, speaking both German and English fluently. During my time at a language-focused middle and high school, I was lucky enough to study Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and Spanish. I developed a special interest in perfecting my Spanish, which led me to study abroad in <span class="place">Malaga, Spain,</span> as well as to work and travel through <span class="place">Ecuador</span> and <span class="place">Peru.</span></p>
	<p>One of my goals coming into college was to learn another language, so I delved into Arabic. Recently, however, I have discovered that studying Computer Science is like learning a dozen languages at once, and I am excited to continue my journey of many languages in this field.</p>
