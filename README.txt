Assignment: Lab 4

Things done correctly:
"resume.html", "bio.html", and "index.html" are completed, as well as 2 CSS stylesheets (one with 6 rules).
"resume.html" contains all the specified information, as does "index.html".
I followed all the Guidelines, as far as I can tell.

One thing not done correctly:
I linked the same stylesheet I used for "resume.html" to "index.html", which worked while I was editing, but stopped working when I accessed the link directly through my browser. I'm not sure where I went wrong.

I did not collaborate or discuss anything with anyone, as I am quite far away from my fellow COMP20 students.

Time spent: approx. 5 hours
